# hello-world
My name is Parshav Saggi and through the web site design course i would like to learn all the aspects of programming in depth so that i can use them as a bridge to do some realtime projects. It is learning opportunity for me as i will get to worl with different tools and get my hands on HTML,CSS and Javascript. These languages will help me learn how a website works in real life scenerio where i can use my imagination and knowledge to build better projects..
